# Weather Wanderer

A 3D elemental transformation game built with Three.js where players harness the power of weather elements to traverse and interact with the environment.

## Game Overview

Weather Wanderer is an immersive 3D game where players control a character that can transform into different weather elements. Each transformation grants unique abilities and ways to interact with the environment.

### Core Mechanics

#### Player Transformations
- **Rain Form**: Ability to flow through narrow passages and interact with plant life
- **Wind Form**: Enhanced movement speed and ability to reach high places
- **Lightning Form**: Quick dash movements and ability to power mechanisms
- **Snow Form**: Create temporary platforms and slow down enemies

#### Environment Interaction
- Dynamic weather system affecting gameplay
- Element-specific environmental puzzles
- Reactive terrain that responds to player's current form

### Technical Architecture

Following Three.js best practices, the game is structured into the following core systems:

#### Core Systems
- `SceneManager`: Handles scene transitions and state management
- `AssetManager`: Centralizes asset loading and caching
- `InputManager`: Processes player input across different forms
- `PhysicsSystem`: Manages collision detection and response
- `RenderManager`: Handles efficient rendering with post-processing effects

#### Component Architecture
- Entity-Component System for flexible object behaviors
- Modular transformation system for player forms
- Event-driven interaction system

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-wanderer.git
cd weather-wanderer
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Performance Optimization

- Level of Detail (LOD) system for complex models
- Efficient particle systems for weather effects
- Shader-based transformations for elemental forms
- Spatial partitioning for collision detection
- Instance rendering for repeated elements

### Controls

- **WASD**: Basic movement
- **Space**: Jump
- **1-4**: Element transformation selection
- **E**: Interact with environment
- **Shift**: Special ability (varies by form)
